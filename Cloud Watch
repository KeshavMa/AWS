Step 1: Access CloudWatch

	1.	Log in to AWS
Go to aws.amazon.com and sign in.
	2.	Go to the CloudWatch Dashboard
Search for CloudWatch in the AWS search bar and open the service.
Step 2: Monitor Metrics

	3.	View Metrics
	•	In the dashboard, go to Metrics to see performance data for your AWS resources (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS).
	•	Example: Check CPU usage for an EC2 instance.
	4.	Create a Custom Dashboard
	•	Click Dashboards and then Create Dashboard.
	•	Add widgets for the metrics you want to monitor (e.g., CPU, memory, network traffic).
	•	Save the dashboard for easy access.
Step 3: Set Up Alarms

	5.	Create an Alarm
	•	Go to the Alarms section and click Create Alarm.
	•	Select a metric (e.g., CPU utilization for an EC2 instance).
	•	Set conditions, like “Trigger an alarm if CPU usage exceeds 80%.
	6.	Set Notifications
	•	Add an action to notify you via email, SMS, or SNS when the alarm is triggered.
	•	You’ll need to verify the notification method (e.g., email).
	7.	Test the Alarm
	•	Simulate high resource usage to see if the alarm triggers correctly.
Step 4: Monitor Logs

	8.	Set Up CloudWatch Logs
	•	Go to Logs and create a log group.
	•	Connect your application or server logs (e.g., EC2 or Lambda) to this group.
	9.	Analyze Logs
	•	Search or filter logs to debug issues or monitor application performance.
Step 5: Create Automated Actions

	10.	Use CloudWatch Events (Optional)
	•	Go to Events and create rules to automate actions.
	•	Example: Trigger an AWS Lambda function if a specific log entry appears.
