Step 1: Access IAM Service

	1.	Log in to AWS
Go to aws.amazon.com and sign in.
	2.	Go to the IAM Dashboard
In the AWS search bar, type IAM and open the IAM Dashboard.
Step 2: Create an IAM User

	3.	Click on “Users”
On the left sidebar, click Users and then Add user.
	4.	Set User Details
	•	User Name: Enter a username (e.g., “TestUser”).
	•	Access Type: Choose Programmatic access for API access or AWS Management Console access for web access. You can select both for full access.
	•	For console access, create a password.
	5.	Set Permissions
	•	Attach Policies: Choose predefined policies (e.g., AdministratorAccess or ReadOnlyAccess) or create a custom policy.
	•	You can also assign the user to a group with permissions or grant permissions individually.
	6.	Review and Create
Review the settings and click Create user.

	7.	Download User Credentials
	•	After the user is created, you will see the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (if programmatic access is enabled).
	•	Download the credentials or copy them for future use. You won’t be able to retrieve them again later.
Step 4: Manage Permissions (Optional)

	8.	Add More Permissions (if needed)
	•	If you need to add more permissions to a user, go back to Users and select the user.
	•	Click on Add permissions to attach additional policies or set custom access.
Step 5: Delete or Disable Users (Optional)

	9.	Disable or Delete User
	•	If you no longer need a user, you can disable their access or delete them entirely by selecting the user in the IAM Dashboard and clicking Delete User.
