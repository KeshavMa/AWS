	1.	Log in to AWS
Go to aws.amazon.com and log in.
	2.	Go to the EC2 Dashboard
Search for EC2 in the AWS search bar and open the EC2 Dashboard.
Step 1: Launch EC2 Instances (Servers)

	3.	Set Up Target Servers
	•	Make sure you have two or more EC2 instances running in different availability zones.
	•	These will act as the servers behind the load balancer.
	•	Install any required application on these instances.
Step 2: Create the Load Balancer

	4.	Navigate to Load Balancers
	•	In the EC2 Dashboard, find Load Balancers under the “Load Balancing” section.
	•	Click Create Load Balancer.
	5.	Choose Load Balancer Type
	•	Select Application Load Balancer (ALB) for web applications.
	•	For TCP-level traffic, use Network Load Balancer (NLB).
	6.	Configure the Load Balancer
	•	Name: Give your load balancer a name (e.g., “MyLoadBalancer”).
	•	Scheme: Choose “Internet-facing” for public access or “Internal” for private.
	•	Listeners: Keep the default settings (e.g., HTTP on port 80).
	7.	Choose Availability Zones
	•	Add at least two subnets in different availability zones.
	•	This ensures high availability.
Step 3: Set Up Target Group

	8.	Create a Target Group
	•	Name the target group (e.g., “MyTargetGroup”).
	•	Select the target type (usually Instance).
	•	Define the health check protocol (e.g., HTTP on port 80).
	9.	Register Instances
	•	Select your EC2 instances and register them with the target group.
Step 4: Finish Load Balancer Setup

	10.	Review and Create
	•	Review all the settings and click Create Load Balancer.
Step 5: Test the Load Balancer

	11.	Access the Load Balancer
	•	Copy the DNS name of the load balancer (found in the Load Balancer details).
	•	Paste it into your browser to test if it distributes traffic to your EC2 instances.
